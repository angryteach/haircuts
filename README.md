# Project

## Summary

* Project name: haircuts
* Web address: N/A
* Purpose: Develop a website for PC and mobile use to display works and get people to book a haircut.

## Layout

I have gone for a grid layout, giving it 4 rows and 3 columns. That was enough to place the most important elements on the page: call-to-action, image carousel, services description, master photo and description, as well as a certificates area.

## Carousel

It has been implemented with a simple CSS keyframes slideshow. It is basic but responsive.
